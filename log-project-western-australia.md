### Research Motivation

Understanding how spatial variation is linked to diversity maintenance
in natural communities is a pillar of plant community ecology.
Theoretically, a variable landscape can maintain diversity via niche
partitioning: different species can trade off in performing better or
worse depending on the conditions of the patch they are growing in, and
as a result, more species can sustainably coexist in a community than if
it were spatially heterogeneous. In the hyperdiverse system of native
annual plants in Western Australia, fallen logs may be one of the
greatest contributors to generating spatial variation that could help
maintain species diversity. Considerable anecdotal evidence suggests
that fallen logs generate spatial variation, or patchiness, in the
environment (Figure 1), and that species or assemblages of plants may
respond differently depending on if they are near logs or not. Despite
such anecdotal evidence, it is yet unknown if and how fallen logs
contribute to maintaining species diversity in the native annual plant
communities of the Western Australian wheat belt.

The project will address the following questions:

**1) Are/how are plant communities in fallen log patches different from
patches that are in the open?**

**2) Why are plant communities in fallen log patches different from
patches in the open?**

**3) Are plant species performances affected by proximity to fallen
logs? **

### Hypotheses

The null hypothesis, H0, is that annual plants in fallen log patches are
not different in diversity, abundance, or composition from open patches.

In addition to the null hypothesis, the following constitute four,
non-mutually exclusive hypotheses concerning how fallen logs may
introduce spatial variation in the environment. I include corresponding
predictions for how plant communities may differ between fallen log
patches as compared to open patches. <br><br> **H1: Log decomposition
creates islands of fertility directly around the fallen log.** <br>
Prediction 1: Nutrient composition around logs will be higher than in
open plots <br>

Prediction 2: Variation in nutrient composition in log vs open
environments will correspond to variation in species composition,
abundance, and/or richness in these environments. <br>

Prediction 3: All sown plants will perform best in environments where
organic logs have been left ‘insitu’. In locations where logs have been
removed or replaced with pvc, the legacy of the nutrient island effect
will yield higher sown plant performance than when compared to locations
where logs have never been. The effect of the nutrient island in
locations where logs have been added to open environments should yeild
higher plant performance over time. *note: performance is measured in
terms of germination rate, survival to fruiting, fecundity, and/or
biomass.* <br><br>

**H2: Fallen logs alter the microclimate directly around them by
providing shade.**<br> Prediction 1: Shade and temperature around logs
vs in open plots will be different <br>

Prediction 2: Variation in shade and temperature in log vs open
environments will correspond to variation in species composition,
abundance, and/or richness in these environments. <br>

Prediction 3: All sown plants will perform best in environments where
there are organic or pvc logs, no matter if they have been recently
moved or not.<br><br>

**H3: Fallen logs trap dispersing seeds as they are blown along the
ground.**<br>

Prediction 1: Dispersing seeds accumulate around logs, leading to a
denser stand of plants in fallen log patches. Plant abundance in fallen
log patches will be higher as compared to open patches. Rare plants will
be more common in fallen log patches as compared to open patches <br>

Prediction 2: All sown plants will perform the same in all experimental
environments <br><br>

**H4: At least some species perform differently according to variation
in log vs. open environments and have short dispersal kernals, causing
fitness-density covariance** <br><br>

### Experimental Design

In this experiment, 224 plots are arranged in 7 blocks of 32 plots each
within the Caron Dam nature reserve. [A map can be found
here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1z6w6tScsCcKSpsdUmoupfOJVaaq16VYk&usp=sharing).
<br>*note: the location info for 3.02 is probably incorrect as of May
2022, and location info is currently unavailable for plots 6.25 and
7.19*

Each block is approximately 30m X 30m in area. Plots are 1m long and
linear, and have a pin tag on either end (see Figure 3). The pin tags
have the identity of the plot written on them in the form of
“blocknumber.plotnumber”. Plots are 1m or more away from each other.

In each block, plot environments can be one of six types:<br> - A 1m log
that is out in the open (open_with_log, 4 plots) <br> - A 1m log that is
a part of a tree (insitu_log, 4 plots)<br> - A 1m pvc pipe that is out
in the open (open_with_pvc, 4 plots)<br> - A 1m pvc pipe that is a part
of a tree (insitu_pvc, 4 plots)<br> - A plot that is out in the open
(open, 8 plots) <br> - A gap in a log where a log used to be (gap, 8
plots)<br>

In half of the plots (not including open plots),the addition, exchange,
or removal of logs or pvc to the environment was implemented in October
2020, before seed dispersal. In the other half of these plots, these
manipulations were implemented after seed dispersal, in March 2021.

Within each 1m long plot, there is a \~20cm long microtransect. The ends
of the microtransects are marked by a nail and a washer sunken into the
ground. Each microtransect is approximately 21 cm in internal length
from inner washer edge to inner washer edge. Microtransects are not
sided.

In half of all plots, seeds were sown in March 2021 and February 2022.
In these plots, 15 seeds each of Trachymene ornata (TROR), Goodenia
rosea (GORO), and Trachymene cyanopetala (TRCY) are sown outside of the
microtransects as in the corresponding diagram. These plants were
selected because they represent plants common to communities next to
logs (TROR), out in the open (GORO), or both (TRCY). The plots where
seeds were sown are called ‘lambda’ plots as noted in Figure 3.

### Datasets

There are two sets of data that I have collected since the project
began.

1)  Community data, before and after the experiment was implemented.
    Every year during peak biomass we surveyed plant communities at
    every centimeter along each microtransect. Plant count and identity
    information is collected at each centimeter. These data are
    available from 2020 (before the experiment began) and 2021 (one year
    into the experiment).

2)  Performance data of TROR, TRCY, and TROR. In 2021, the only
    performance data that were collected after sowing the experiment
    were the total number of plants that came up and survived to
    fruiting for each species in each location, as well as their total
    biomass. This was because of logistical issues due to covid. In
    2022, no performance data has been collected yet. I am planning on
    collecting germination rate, survival over the season, and
    fecundity.

### Preliminary analysis

##### 1) Are/how are plant communities in fallen log patches different from patches that are in the open? <br>

The ways I have looked at this so far are to compare the initial
composition of annual plant communities in log vs. open plots before we
implemented the experiment. I am suppressing the display of most of the
data wrangling code in the output in the following stuff, but if you’d
like to see you can take a look at what’s in the .Rmd file.

**Abundance** <br> First, I look at the abundance of microtransect
plants in log vs open plots in 2020. For this analysis, I include all
plants including unknown plants. I find that log transects have
marginally significantly more plants than open transects, but it really
is a marginal difference (mean difference is approximately a half a
plant).

**Diversity**<br> Next, I look at the diversity of microtransect plants
in log vs open plots in 2020. For the below analysis, I take a
conservative approach and only include known species, because most of
the unknown species were a result of not being able to differentiate
between known species. Diversity is Shannon’s diversity index and
estimated by pooling the species in each treatment type in each block
(N=14). Shannon’s diversity is not different between the two
environments.

``` r
# what does our data look like? 
hist(dat1$diversity) # pretty normal!
```

![](log-project-western-australia_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
## model, this time I can add a random effect for block. diversity in this case is shannon's diversity of each transect 
div.mod<-lmer(diversity~init+(1|block), data=dat1)

# summary 
summary(div.mod)
```

    ## Linear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']
    ## Formula: diversity ~ init + (1 | block)

```

![](log-project-western-australia_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png)<!-- -->

Just for kicks, I can also look at species rarefaction curves, which
tell me how quickly species accumulate in my surveys. I chose to make
curves for all initial treatment X block combinations (14 curves).

![](log-project-western-australia_files/figure-gfm/rarefaction%20code-1.png)<!-- -->

**Dissimilarity** <br> Finally, I can look at how communities are
different in the two different initial treatments - i.e. how different
open vs log locations were before we initiated the experiment. For this
analysis, I do not include unknown species. I do include cases where
there are no individuals in the community.

In the following analysis, I use nonmetric multidimensional scaling,
variance partitioning, redundancy analysis, and partial redundancy
analysis to understand the relative contributions of the initial
treatment (log or open) and block (1-7) to overall community
composition. First, I look at how well initial treatment and block
jointly describe variation in community composition using an rda
analysis.

``` r
#### rda model analysis & results #### 
# can look at significance of model where initial treatment and block explain variation in community
trt_tot<-rda(ass.rel.t0~init+block) # run model using standardized data 
anova.cca(trt_tot) ## test for model significance
```

    ## Permutation test for rda under reduced model
    ## Permutation: free
    ## Number of permutations: 999
    ## 
    ## Model: rda(formula = ass.rel.t0 ~ init + block)
    ##          Df Variance     F Pr(>F)    
    ## Model     7  0.32147 2.626  0.001 ***
    ## Residual  6  0.10493                 
    ## ---
    ## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1

As you can tell, the overall model of initial treatment+block
significantly explains variation in the data.

I can then look at how initial treatment and block separately describe
variation in community composition using variance partitioning analyses,
and test the significance of the contribution of initial treatment in
explaining variation.

As shown in the varpart venn diagram, the variance partitioning analysis
indicates that the initial treatment only contributes about 8% explained
variation in the full model. We can test if the contribution of initial
treatment is significant using partial redundancy analysis. see `?rda`
for details.

![](log-project-western-australia_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

    ## Permutation test for rda under reduced model
    ## Permutation: free
    ## Number of permutations: 999
    ## 
    ## Model: rda(X = ass.rel.t0, Y = init, Z = block)
    ##          Df Variance      F Pr(>F)  
    ## Model     1 0.036127 2.0657  0.068 .
    ## Residual  6 0.104933                
    ## ---
    ## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1

Despite only explaining about 8% of variation, the contribution of
initial treatment (open / log) is marginally significant (p-value sits
around 0.05). Log communities and open communities are therefore
marginally significantly different from each other in their overall
composition.

Let’s visualize the differences in the communities using an ordination
plot:

<center>
![](log-project-western-australia_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->
</center>

In this plot, the points represent blocks, and the colors represent log
vs open initial treatment. Species are represented by a four letter
species code and their position is not jittered. If there is a line
attached to a species code, the other end of the line indicates where
the actual location is in the ordination.

Two things to note here: there were 22 species that didn’t have loadings
in the nmds, perhaps because they were too rare (*note: still need to
look into this*). In this initial analysis, we can see that TROR falls
out as a ‘log’ species, GORO as an ‘open’ species, and TRCY sits where
the two groups overlap, so our intuition about these species was
correct.

##### 2) Why are plant communities in fallen log patches different from patches in the open?

This can be answered by comparing community abundance, diversity, and
dissimilarity among experimental treatments in 2021 and beyond. It can
also be corroborated by looking at environmental correlates to the
changes we observe among treatments as time goes on. I’m not quite sure
how to do this at the moment.

##### 3) How is plant species performance affected by proximity to fallen logs?

This can be answered by comparing performance of sown plants among
experimental treatments in 2021 and beyond.
