Understanding how spatial variation is linked to diversity maintenance in natural communities is a pillar of plant community ecology. Theoretically, a variable landscape can maintain diversity via niche partitioning: different species can trade off in performing better or worse depending on the conditions of the patch they are growing in, and as a result, more species can sustainably coexist in a community than if it were spatially homogeneous. In the hyperdiverse system of native annual plants in Western Australia, fallen logs may be one of the greatest contributors to generating spatial variation that could help maintain species diversity. Considerable anecdotal evidence suggests that fallen logs generate spatial variation, or patchiness, in the environment (Figure 1), and that species or assemblages of plants may respond differently depending on if they are near logs or not. Despite such anecdotal evidence, it is yet unknown if and how fallen logs contribute to maintaining species diversity in the native annual plant communities of the Western Australian wheat belt.

The project will address the following questions: 

**Q1) Do T. ornata, T. cyanopetala and G. rosea exhibit differential performance with the presence of fallen logs?**

**Q2) Do plant communities in fallen log patches differ from those in the open areas?** 

**Q3) If so, why are they different from one another?** 

### Hypotheses
**H1: Log decomposition creates islands of fertility directly around the fallen log.** <br>
Prediction 1: Nutrient composition around logs will be higher than in open plots <br>

**H2: At least some species perform differently according to variation in log vs. open environments.** <br><br>
Prediction 3: All sown plants will perform best in environments where organic logs have been left 'insitu'. In locations where logs have been removed or replaced with pvc, the legacy of the nutrient island effect will yield higher sown plant performance than when compared to locations where logs have never been. The effect of the nutrient island in locations where logs have been added to open environments should yeild higher plant performance over time. *note: performance is measured in terms of germination rate, survival to fruiting, fecundity, and/or biomass.* <br><br>

**H3: Fallen logs alter the plant community in terms of species composition, abundance, and/or richness.**

**H4: Differences in plant community in log vs. open environments can be attributed to either physical barrier effect or soil conditioning effect.**

### Experimental Design
In this experiment, 224 plots are arranged in 7 blocks of 32 plots each within the Caron Dam nature reserve. [A map can be found here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1z6w6tScsCcKSpsdUmoupfOJVaaq16VYk&usp=sharing). <br>*note: the location info for 3.02 is probably incorrect as of May 2022, and location info is currently unavailable for plots 6.25 and 7.19* 

Each block is approximately 30m X 30m in area. Plots are 1m long and linear, and have a pin tag on either end (see Figure 3). The pin tags have the identity of the plot written on them in the form of "blocknumber.plotnumber". Plots are 1m or more away from each other. 

In each block, plot environments can be one of six types:<br>
-	A 1m log that is out in the open (open_with_log,  4 plots)  <br>
-	A 1m log that is a part of a tree (insitu_log, 4 plots)<br>
-	A 1m pvc pipe that is out in the open (open_with_pvc, 4 plots)<br>
-	A 1m pvc pipe that is a part of a tree (insitu_pvc, 4 plots)<br>
-	A plot that is out in the open (open, 8 plots) <br>
-	A gap in a log where a log used to be (gap, 8 plots)<br>

In half of the plots (not including open plots), the addition, exchange, or removal of logs or pvc to the environment was implemented in October 2020, before seed dispersal. In the other half of these plots, these manipulations were implemented after seed dispersal, in March 2021. 

Within each 1m long plot, there is a ~20cm long microtransect. The ends of the microtransects are marked by a nail and a washer sunken into the ground. Each microtransect is approximately 21 cm in internal length from inner washer edge to inner washer edge. Microtransects are not sided. 

In half of all plots, seeds were sown in March 2021 and February 2022. In these plots, 15 seeds each of Trachymene ornata (TROR), Goodenia rosea (GORO), and Trachymene cyanopetala (TRCY) are sown outside of the microtransects as in the diagram. These plants were selected because they represent plants common to communities next to logs (TROR), out in the open (GORO), or both (TRCY). The plots where seeds were sown are called 'lambda' plots as noted in Figure 3. In the dataset, the rows with a "1" in the 'seeding_trt' column are the plots that had seeds sown into them.

### Datasets 
The sets of data that we have collected for this arm of the project are the following. 

(1) Community data, before and after the experiment was implemented. <br> 
- Every year during peak biomass we surveyed plant communities at every centimeter along each microtransect. Plant count and identity information is collected at each centimeter. 
- These data are available from 2020 (before the experiment began), 2021 (one year into the experiment), and 2022 (two years into the experiment)

(2) Soil nutrient analysis in the open and insitu log plots.<br>
- In 2022, we sampled 14 soil samples taken from one insitu_open plot and one insitu_log plot from each of the seven blocks. At each plot, three 5-cm deep soil cores from random positions were collected with the use of a Hamilton tree planter. Particularly in insitu_log plots, soil cores were removed within a five-centimeter zone adjacent to the coarse wood debris. Between each extraction, all tools were sterilised with 80% ethanol to prevent cross contamination. Soil cores from each plot were then mixed, cooled and immediately transported to a commercial laboratory (CSBP laboratories). Nutrient analysis was conducted at CSBP laboratories to determine soil pH, organic C, P, K, inorganic nitrogen (NO3- and NO4+) and basic exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, Na and K). All basic exchangeable cations were summed together and labelled as "CEC".

(3) Performance data of TROR, TRCY, and TROR. <br>
- In 2021, the only performance data that were collected after sowing the experiment were the **total number of plants that came up and survived to fruiting for each species in each location, their total biomass, and their per capita biomass**. I calculated per capita biomass by dividing total biomass of the collected focal plants by the number of focal plants observed. This was because of logistical issues due to covid. In this dataset, there were two instances where the number of plants collected was greater than the number of seeds sown. Both instances were T. cyanopetala, where nplants = 16 and 18. For these two datapoints I chose to convert the count values to 15, assuming that every individual we planted came up, and that the extra were either naturally occurring seeds or that the number of seeds that we put into the ground was greater than 15 (human error). To calculate total biomass for these two instances, I divided the total biomass by the number of individuals observed, and multiplied by 15. <br>

- In 2022, we went to the field early in the season and counted and thinned the number of germinated seedlings in each location. We therefore have a count for germination, but for the following reasons there are some issues with these data. The first is that we probably surveyed germination a little too early. The seedlings were often super small or hadn't come up yet. Because we couldn't come back later to re-thin the plots, we went ahead with counting and thinning seedlings. The values in the dataset for 2022 (nplants_data_2022.csv) corresponding to this germination survey are "ntrcy_germ", "ngoro_germ" and "ntror_germ". The second is that at the end of the growing season, Jake and Winnie came back and found that there was often more than one plant of the focal species where we seeded them, and sometimes there was one or more focal plants that popped up where we had not observed germination earlier in the season. We assume that these plants come from the seeds we planted, and that they came up later than our initial germination survey. The number of plants observed and collected at each location at the end of the season are in the columns "nplants_tror", "nplants_goro" and "nplants_trcy" in the nplants_data_2022.csv data file. Because ngerm and nplants don't totally capture what came up where we sowed seed, I chose to analyze the total number of observed plants. I calculated this as the number of total plants we observed between the germination and the end of the season, being careful not to double-count the individual that was left after thinning from the first round of germination survey. The performance data I analyze here are **total number of plants that came up for each species in each location, and the per capita biomass of plants collected at the end of the season**. 

## Methods and analysis
### **Q1 Are/how are plant species performances affected by proximity to fallen logs?**<br>
#### *Overview of results* <br> 

**2021** 

There are three response variables: presence (binomial), count (truncated poisson), and per capita biomass (gaussian).

*Presence*

- The best fit model for presence is a tie between between physical barrier and the additive model of physical barrier + nutrient island (deltaAIC=0.32). I present the model analysis of the additive model. 
- Both TRCY and TROR are significantly more likely to be present where there is a physical barrier as compared to in the open (TRCY: p=0.03, TROR: p=0.01) 
- Nutrient island does not significantly explain variation in presence/absence in any species. However, there is a trend across all species that they are more likely present in log-legacy plots. 

*Count* 

- The best fit model for count is nutrient island. 
- Nutrient island does not strongly significantly explain variation in presence/absence in any species. However, TRCY is marginally significantly affected by nutrient island, where there are more TRCY in plots where there is a `log legacy' (there had been a decomposing log in the plot before the experiment began)

*Biomass*

- The best fit model for per capita biomass is the nutrient island, then physical barrier island, then the additive model. They are all within 2 AICc points of each other (deltaAIC=1.55 and 1.76, respectively). I present the model analysis of the additive model.
- Nutrient island significantly explains variation GORO biomass, where there are larger GORO plants in plots where there is a `log legacy' (p=0.03).
- Physical barrier does not explain variation in biomass for any species. 

**2022**

There are again three response variables: presence (binomial), count (truncated poisson), and per capita biomass (gaussian).

*Presence*

1. The best fit model for presence is a tie between between physical barrier and the additive model of physical barrier + nutrient island (deltaAIC=0.24). I present the model analysis of the additive model. 

2. Both TRCY and TROR are significantly more likely to be present where there is a physical barrier as compared to in the open (TRCY: p=0.007, TROR: p=0.03) 

3. Nutrient island significantly explains the presence/absence of TRCY, where TRCY is more likely to be present in log legacy plots as compared to open legacy plots (p=0.02) 

*Count* 

1. The best fit model for count is a tie between nutrient island and physical barrier. I present the model analysis of the nutrient island model. 

2. Nutrient island does not strongly significantly explain variation in presence/absence in any species. 

*Biomass*

1. The best fit model for per capita biomass is the nutrient island, then the additive model, then the physical barrier model. They are all within 1 AICc points of each other (deltaAIC=0.31 and 0.46, respectively). I present the model analysis of the additive model.

2. Nutrient island significantly explains variation in TROR biomass, where log legacy plots have larger TROR as compared to open legacy plots (p=0.04)

3. Physical barrier significantly explains variation in TROR biomass, where plots in the open have larger TROR than plots near a physical barrier (either log or PVC pipe) (p=0.02)


#### *Statistical Methods* <br>
The basic approach is to analyse count and biomass data from 2021 and 2022 sowing experiment. We sowed 15 seeds for each species into 16 plots in each of the seven blocks. There are 6 plot type treatments. The gap and open treatments each have four replicates per block, and the insitu_log, insitu_pvc, open_with_log, and open_with_pvc each have two replicates per block. *note: For each treatment of plot type, there is also a dispersal treatment, but I do not analyse that here (yet).*
<br> 
- For **count data** I use a glmmTMB to run a generalized linear mixed effects model approach to analyse the data. The hurdle model approach I am using is to first code presence/absence as 0 or 1 (1 being any nonzero count value) and run this analysis as a binomial regression. Depending on the model fit and residual dispersion (using DHARMa), I then either run a truncated poisson or truncated negative binomial regression on the count data. Though I did run alternative versions of hurdle models that predict count while accounting for zero inflation, I felt that analyzing the presence/absence, and then analyzing count, may be revealing more of the biology of the system, where presence/absence was distinctly affected by treatments while count was less so.
<br>
- For **biomass data** I use linear mixed effects model to analyse the per capita biomass data. I first do a log(1+n) transformation on the per capita biomass, then analyze. I chose to do per capita biomass because of recalcitrant (!!) residual dispersion in total biomass, even after attemtps at log and square root transformations.
<br>
I chose to do a model selection approach, which I'm trying to move away from generally. However, the models I use to analyze the data represent different hypotheses about *why* plant species might perform differently, and so I chose to do a model comparison and selection approach as a way to not only understand how plant species performance is affected by proximity to fallen logs, but also gain insight as to why this may be the case. 

N.B.:Model comparison might not be the approach we want, and we may want to run the analysis differently. I'm open to discussion and change on this point. 

After model comparison, I use estimated marginal means (package emmeans) on the best fit model and compute the significance of the difference in estimates.

The models I use test the hypotheses from above: Log decomposition creates islands of fertility directly around the fallen log and fallen logs alter the microclimate directly around them by providing shade.

## because of the way weeding worked, where we thinned only once and probably too early in the season, there were cases where plants came up, we thinned them, and then when we collected plants at the end of the growing season there were more that popped up. 
# I am choosing to use the total number of a species that popped up in the zone of planting. this required a somewhat complex excel formula that did not double-count the one individual when summing the total, and also accounts for the plants that came up but
# did not survive. This value is called 'tot' (e.g. ngoro_tot). 
# It's impossible to get the same dataset as the one from 2021 because we planted the plants and only came back when it was time to collect at the end of the season, thus capturing both survival through the season and germination. 
# to get the total in the "tot" columns, I wrote a formula in excel, written below
# total = if((t0+t2=0),0,if(t0=0,t2,if(t2=0,t0, if(t0+t2=1,1,(t0-1+t2)))))
# in this expression t0 is the germ value (e.g. ngoro_germ) and t2 is the plants value (e.g. ngoro_plants). 
# I can run the analysis with germ, plants, or tot. I'm choosing to do the analysis on tot, but we can revisit this choice if we feel there's a better way to comparably (or not) analyze the data between 2021 and 2023.

### **Q2 Do plant communities in fallen log patches differ from those in the open areas??** <br>
#### *Overview of results* <br> 
Quick recap:

1.    Plant abundance did not differ between log and open plots across all years. 

2.    Plant diversity did not differ between log and open plots across all years. 

3.    Plot treatment (log vs open) explained a smaller proportion of variance in plant species composition than block, consistent across years.

To compare the characteristic of plant communities in fallen log patches and open patches, we assessed differences in plant abundance, diversity using the Shannon diversity index, and plant composition summarized at the block level. The analysis is organized by year - we analysed the community data for each year separately: 2020, 2021, and 2022. In these analyses, we evaluated three response variables: abundance, diversity, and plant composition.

*2020*

There are three response variables: count (Gaussian), Shannon diversity index (Gaussian), and composition matrix.

1.	*Abundance* – No difference in total plant count between log patches and open patches (p = 0.504). Model: total count ~ treatment(log/open)

2.	*Diversity* – No difference in plant diversity (SDI) between log patches and open patches (p = 0.209). Model: diversity ~ treatment(log/open)

3.	*Composition* – RDA partitions variance in plant composition by R-squared. 
Adjusted R-squared 0.2349
Treatment R2: 0.08633
Block R2: 0.56055 **
The analysis of variation partitioning uses an adjusted R-squared method to express the variance explained by the explanatory matrix. The variable 'treatment' alone explains about 8.63% of the total variance, while the 'block' explains roughly 56.1% of the variance.  Note that the shared fraction in the Venn diagram is not shown as it is negative, likely due to 'treatment' being a suppressor variable with a close-to-zero relationship to plant composition. (Read: https://www.jstor.org/stable/20069271). 

*2021*

1.	*Abundance* – No difference between total plant count between log patches and open patches (p = 0.597). Model: total count ~ treatment(log/open)

2.	*Diversity* – No difference in plant diversity (SDI) between log patches and open patches (p = 0.642). Model: diversity ~ treatment(log/open)

3.	*Composition* – 
Adjusted R-squared: 0.2593985
Treatment R2: 0.12083 **
Block R2: 0.53735 **

*2022*

1.	*Abundance* – No difference between total plant count between log patches and open patches (p = 0.712). Model: total count ~ treatment(log/open)

2.	*Diversity* – No difference in plant diversity (SDI) between log patches and open patches (p = 0.659). Model: diversity ~ treatment(log/open)

3.	*Composition* – 
Adjusted R-squared: 0.2861857
Treatment R2: 0.11388 *
Block R2: 0.55667 **

#### *Statistical Methods* <br> 

1.	Abundance comparison 

Comparison of plant abundance between log and open plots involves two types of data: (1) the total plant counts of individual plots of all plots in 2020 before the experiment set up, which includes two initial treatments - "log" and "open"; and (2) the total plant counts from insitu_log and insitu_open plots in 2021 and 2022 respectively. All count data used for abundance comparison includes species with unknown identity. We used a GLM to model the abundance of plant individuals (2020, 2021 and 2022 data) in unaltered fallen log patches and open patches using a Gaussian distribution structure.

2.	Diversity comparison 

A 20-centimeter linear transect was set up for each plot in 2020. We recorded species identity and individual counts for all species occurring along the transects in 2020, 2021 and 2022 respectively. Comparison of plant diversity between log and open patches involves two types of data: 1. The count of plants for each species in individual plots of all plots in the year 2020, before the experiment setup. The data is differentiated based on the initial treatment of "log" and "open". 2. The count of plants for each species in individual plots from insitu_log and insitu_open plots in the years 2021 and 2022, respectively. All species with unknown identity have been excluded from the data used for diversity comparison. The diversity of plants in each community (i.e. plot) was measured by Shannon diversity index (SDI). We used a GLM to model the SDI for each year using a Gaussian distribution structure.

3.	Composition 

Comparison of plant composition between log patches and open patches involves two types of data: 1. The count of plants for each species in individual plots of all plots in the year 2020, before the experiment setup. The data is differentiated based on the initial treatment of "log" and "open". 2. The count of plants for each species in individual plots from insitu_log and insitu_open plots in the years 2021 and 2022, respectively. All data used for diversity comparison excludes species with unknown identity. For transects where no plants were found, an artificial species, "x," was added to the species composition matrix to represent zero plants. Data is structured at the plot level with each row representing the composition of plant species in an individual plot. There are 223 plots in 2020, 86 plots in 2021, and 84 plots in 2022, evenly nested in 7 blocks. 

We compared plant species composition between plot treatments (i.e. open vs log) with two separate streams of analyses (1) partial Redundancy Analysis (RDA) + permutation test (ANOVA.acc)+ variation partioning analysis (Venn diagram) and (2) NMDS + ANOSIM (Analysis of Similarities). 

(3.1) We ran a Redundancy Analysis (RDA) to test the correlation between species composition (squared-root transformed) and plot treatment (log vs open patch). 'Block' is a fixed term since we have only one data point for each treatment for each block. Significance of model and 'treatment' term were tested with a permutation test (anova.cca function from vegan package). Variation in plant composition explained by plot treatment and block were partitioned and reported in an adjusted R-squared value in a Venn diagram. 

(3.2) Alternatively, we used Non-Metric Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) to analyse the differences in plant communities with Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metrics. For each combination of NMDS axes generated, we plotted a two-dimensional NMDS ordination plot to visualize and interpret the relative position of plant community between plot types and blocks. To better understand the contribution of each species to the compositional changes, we extracted and plotted the ordination scores for each species along each respective NMDS axis. These scores represent the weighted average of a species' abundance score in a sample community along each selected NMDS axes. To further test the degree of similarity in plant species composition between plot treatment types, we used the ANOSIM function, and the resulting R-statistic value depicts the proportion of dissimilarity.

### **Q3 Why are plant communities in fallen log patches different from patches in the open?**<br>
#### *Overview of results* <br>  

1. Soil K and P have similar PCA loadings. In subsequent analysis, we may simplify the model structure by keeping only either K or P and still be able to infer the effects of the other. 

2. Total soil C (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p = 0.025) and plant available N (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p = 0.031) are significantly higher in log patches than open patches
