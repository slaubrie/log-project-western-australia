Understanding how spatial variation is linked to diversity maintenance in natural communities is a pillar of plant community ecology. Theoretically, a variable landscape can maintain diversity via niche partitioning: different species can trade off in performing better or worse depending on the conditions of the patch they are growing in, and as a result, more species can sustainably coexist in a community than if it were spatially heterogeneous. In the hyperdiverse system of native annual plants in Western Australia, fallen logs may be one of the greatest contributors to generating spatial variation that could help maintain species diversity. Considerable anecdotal evidence suggests that fallen logs generate spatial variation, or patchiness, in the environment (Figure 1), and that species or assemblages of plants may respond differently depending on if they are near logs or not. Despite such anecdotal evidence, it is yet unknown if and how fallen logs contribute to maintaining species diversity in the native annual plant communities of the Western Australian wheat belt.

The project will address the following questions: 

**Q1) Are/how are plant communities in fallen log patches different from patches that are in the open?**

**Q2) Why are plant communities in fallen log patches different from patches in the open?** 

**Q3) Are/how are plant species performances affected by proximity to fallen logs?** 

### Hypotheses
The null hypothesis, H0, is that annual plants in fallen log patches are not different in diversity, abundance, or composition from open patches. 

In addition to the null hypothesis, the following constitute four, non-mutually exclusive hypotheses concerning how fallen logs may introduce spatial variation in the environment. I include corresponding predictions for how plant communities may differ between fallen log patches as compared to open patches.
<br><br>
**H1: Log decomposition creates islands of fertility directly around the fallen log.** <br>
Prediction 1: Nutrient composition around logs will be higher than in open plots <br>

Prediction 2: Variations in nutrient composition in log vs open environments will correspond to variations in species composition, abundance, and/or richness in these environments. <br>

Prediction 3: All sown plants will perform best in environments where organic logs have been left 'insitu'.  In locations where logs have been removed or replaced with pvc, the legacy of the nutrient island effect will yield higher sown plant performance than when compared to locations where logs have never been. The effect of the nutrient island in locations where logs have been added to open environments should yeild higher plant performance over time. *note: performance is measured in terms of germination rate, survival to fruiting, fecundity, and/or biomass.* <br><br>

**H2: Fallen logs alter the microclimate directly around them by providing shade.**<br> Prediction 1: Shade and temperature around logs vs in open plots will be different <br>

Prediction 2: Variation in shade and temperature in log vs open environments will correspond to variation in species composition, abundance, and/or richness in these environments. <br>

Prediction 3: All sown plants will perform best in environments where there are organic or pvc logs, no matter if they have been recently moved or not.<br><br>

**H3: Fallen logs trap dispersing seeds as they are blown along the ground.**<br>

Prediction 1: Dispersing seeds accumulate around logs, leading to a denser stand of plants in fallen log patches. Plant abundance in fallen log patches will be higher as compared to open patches. Rare plants will be more common in fallen log patches as compared to open patches <br>

Prediction 2: All sown plants will perform the same in all experimental environments <br><br>

**H4: At least some species perform differently according to variation in log vs. open environments and have short dispersal kernels, causing fitness-density covariance** <br><br>

### Experimental Design
In this experiment, 224 plots are arranged in 7 blocks of 32 plots each within the Caron Dam nature reserve. [A map can be found here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1z6w6tScsCcKSpsdUmoupfOJVaaq16VYk&usp=sharing). <br>*note: the location info for 3.02 is probably incorrect as of May 2022, and location info is currently unavailable for plots 6.25 and 7.19* 

Each block is approximately 30m X 30m in area. Plots are 1m long and linear, and have a pin tag on either end (see Figure 3). The pin tags have the identity of the plot written on them in the form of "blocknumber.plotnumber". Plots are 1m or more away from each other. 

In each block, plot environments can be one of six types:<br>
-	A 1m log that is out in the open (open_with_log,  4 plots)  <br>
-	A 1m log that is a part of a tree (insitu_log, 4 plots)<br>
-	A 1m pvc pipe that is out in the open (open_with_pvc, 4 plots)<br>
-	A 1m pvc pipe that is a part of a tree (insitu_pvc, 4 plots)<br>
-	A plot that is out in the open (open, 8 plots) <br>
-	A gap in a log where a log used to be (gap, 8 plots)<br>

In half of the plots (not including open plots), the addition, exchange, or removal of logs or pvc to the environment was implemented in October 2020, before seed dispersal. In the other half of these plots, these manipulations were implemented after seed dispersal, in March 2021. 

Within each 1m long plot, there is a ~20cm long microtransect. The ends of the microtransects are marked by a nail and a washer sunken into the ground. Each microtransect is approximately 21 cm in internal length from inner washer edge to inner washer edge. Microtransects are not sided. 

In half of all plots, seeds were sown in March 2021 and February 2022. In these plots, 15 seeds each of Trachymene ornata (TROR), Goodenia rosea (GORO), and Trachymene cyanopetala (TRCY) are sown outside of the microtransects as in the diagram. These plants were selected because they represent plants common to communities next to logs (TROR), out in the open (GORO), or both (TRCY). The plots where seeds were sown are called 'lambda' plots as noted in Figure 3. In the dataset, the rows with a "1" in the 'seeding_trt' column are the plots that had seeds sown into them.

### Datasets 
The sets of data that we have collected for this arm of the project are the following. 

(1) Community data, before and after the experiment was implemented. <br> 
- Every year during peak biomass we surveyed plant communities at every centimeter along each microtransect. Plant count and identity information is collected at each centimeter. 
- These data are available from 2020 (before the experiment began), 2021 (one year into the experiment), and 2022 (two years into the experiment)

(2) Soil nutrient analysis in the open and insitu log plots.<br>
- These data were collected in 2023 

(3) Performance data of TROR, TRCY, and TROR. <br>
- In 2021, the only performance data that were collected after sowing the experiment were the **total number of plants that came up and survived to fruiting for each species in each location, their total biomass, and their per capita biomass**. I calculated per capita biomass by dividing total biomass of the collected focal plants by the number of focal plants observed. This was because of logistical issues due to covid. In this dataset, there were two instances where the number of plants collected was greater than the number of seeds sown. Both instances were T. cyanopetala, where nplants = 16 and 18. For these two datapoints I chose to convert the count values to 15, assuming that every individual we planted came up, and that the extra were either naturally occurring seeds or that the number of seeds that we put into the ground was greater than 15 (human error). To calculate total biomass for these two instances, I divided the total biomass by the number of individuals observed, and multiplied by 15. <br>

- In 2022, we went to the field early in the season and counted and thinned the number of germinated seedlings in each location. We therefore have a count for germination, but for the following reasons there are some issues with these data. The first is that we probably surveyed germination a little too early. The seedlings were often super small or hadn't come up yet. Because we couldn't come back later to re-thin the plots, we went ahead with counting and thinning seedlings. The values in the dataset for 2022 (nplants_data_2022.csv) corresponding to this germination survey are "ntrcy_germ", "ngoro_germ" and "ntror_germ". The second is that at the end of the growing season, Jake and Winnie came back and found that there was often more than one plant of the focal species where we seeded them, and sometimes there was one or more focal plants that popped up where we had not observed germination earlier in the season. We assume that these plants come from the seeds we planted, and that they came up later than our initial germination survey. The number of plants observed and collected at each location at the end of the season are in the columns "nplants_tror", "nplants_goro" and "nplants_trcy" in the nplants_data_2022.csv data file. Because ngerm and nplants don't totally capture what came up where we sowed seed, I chose to analyze the total number of observed plants. I calculated this as the number of total plants we observed between the germination and the end of the season, being careful not to double-count the individual that was left after thinning from the first round of germination survey. The performance data I analyze here are **total number of plants that came up for each species in each location, and the per capita biomass of plants collected at the end of the season**. 

## Methods and analysis

### **Q1 Are/how are plant communities in fallen log patches different from patches that are in the open?** <br>
#### *Overview of results* <br> 
1.	The abundance of plants in fallen log patches and patches that are in the open (hereafter referred to as open patches) are similar.
2.	Plant species diversity is significantly higher in log patches than in open patches, as measured by the Shannon diversity index.
3.	The two-dimensional NMDS plot types can be separated into two groups that overlap - fallen log patches and open patches. Based on the plant species compositions, the fallen open patches consistently have a higher score than fallen log patches along NMDS axes 1 across three years of analysis. According to RDA, plot types accounted for about 8% (2020), 12.1% (2021), and 11.4% (2022) of variations in species composition. Ordinations of plots sampled from the same block are always close to each other, reflecting the spatial proximity of plant communities within the same block. The relative arrangement of plots also defines a non-dimensional space that encloses common species that drive the shift of species composition between the two plot types. Meanwhile, the relative position of plots on the peripherals is influenced by rare species that occupy relatively extreme values along either NMDS axes 1 or 2.

#### *Statistical Methods* <br>
1.	Abundance
Plant counts of all plots in 2020 before the experiment setup and plant abundance data from in-situ logs and in-situ open plots in 2021 and 2022 were used in the analyses for diversity, abundance, and composition differences. We used a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to model the abundance of plant individuals (2020, 2021 and 2022 data) in unaltered fallen log patches and open patches using a Poisson distribution structure with year and block as random terms.
2.	Diversity
A considerable number of zeros are generated in the computation of the Shannon diversity index. We used a two-component hurdle model on the truncated data set where the response variable was separated into zero and non-zero values. The first component uses a binomial GLMER to model the probability of zeros and non-zeros in the diversity index with block and year as random terms. The second component uses a linear mixed-effects model to test the effect of fallen logs and open patches on the non-zero species diversity index with year and block as random factors.
3.	Composition
We used Non-Metric Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) to analyse the differences in plant communities with Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metrics. We retained two dimensions in the NMDS ordination plot for the interpretation of plant community composition differences between plot types and blocks. To identify the contribution of each species to the compositional changes amongst different sample plots, we extracted ordination scores for each species along NMDS axes 1 and 2. The species scores represent the weighted average of a species’ abundance score in a sample community along our selected NMDS axes. We also ran a partial Redundancy Analysis (RDA) to test the correlation between species composition (squared-root transformed) and plot type (log vs open patch) with block as a random term.

# (1) Samples from t1 and t2 from are from the same plots as t0. These are not independent replicates and tend to correlated with each other.
# We included year and block as random effects to alleviate the effect of temporal pseudo-replication.

summary(aov(total ~ time, data = dat_t0_insitu)) # plant abundance differs between years

# (2) When we stratify the data by year, significance of the difference between log and open treatment is lost.
# if the effect of log-open (slope) is the same across year, year only affecting the intercept.
# since the slopes are similar, we include time as random intercept effect.

##### Diversity analysis
Main takeaways:

* we use a hurdle model to address zero-inflation
* we first use logistic regression to predict the probability of non-zero
* open and log environment significantly determines the probability of non-zero diversity index
* note, zero in Shannon diversity index does not mean zero plant. 
* we then use lmer to model non-zero diversity data with time and block as random terms
* we assume approximal Gaussian distribution (1) continuous variable and (2) visual inspection suggests so

#### *Interpretation* 


### **Q3 Are/how are plant species performances affected by proximity to fallen logs?**<br>
#### *Overview of results* <br> 

#### *Statistical Methods* <br>
The basic approach is to analyse count and biomass data from 2021 and 2022 sowing experiment. We sowed 15 seeds for each species into 16 plots in each of the seven blocks. There are 6 plot type treatments. The gap and open treatments each have four replicates per block, and the insitu_log, insitu_pvc, open_with_log, and open_with_pvc each have two replicates per block. *note: For each treatment of plot type, there is also a dispersal treatment, but I do not analyse that here (yet).*
<br> 
- For **count data** I use a glmmTMB to run a generalized linear mixed effects model approach to analyse the data. The hurdle model approach I am using is to first code presence/absence as 0 or 1 (1 being any nonzero count value) and run this analysis as a binomial regression. Depending on the model fit and residual dispersion (using DHARMa), I then either run a truncated poisson or truncated negative binomial regression on the count data. Though I did run alternative versions of hurdle models that predict count while accounting for zero inflation, I felt that analyzing the presence/absence, and then analyzing count, may be revealing more of the biology of the system, where presence/absence was distinctly affected by treatments while count was less so.
<br>
- For **biomass data** I use linear mixed effects model to analyse the per capita biomass data. I first do a log(1+n) transformation on the per capita biomass, then analyze. I chose to do per capita biomass because of recalcitrant (!!) residual dispersion in total biomass, even after attemtps at log and square root transformations.
<br>
I chose to do a model selection approach, which I'm trying to move away from generally. However, the models I use to analyze the data represent different hypotheses about *why* plant species might perform differently, and so I chose to do a model comparison and selection approach as a way to not only understand how plant species performance is affected by proximity to fallen logs, but also gain insight as to why this may be the case. 

The models I use test the hypotheses from above: Log decomposition creates islands of fertility directly around the fallen log and fallen logs alter the microclimate directly around them by providing shade. I can also investigate using the different response variables if logs affect the presence/absence of plants, the number of plants that come up, or the biomass of the plants in the end.

## because of the way weeding worked, where we thinned only once and probably too early in the season, there were cases where plants came up, we thinned them, and then when we collected plants at the end of the growing season there were more that popped up. 
# I am choosing to use the total number of a species that popped up in the zone of planting. this required a somewhat complex excel formula that did not double-count the one individual when summing the total, and also accounts for the plants that came up but
# did not survive. This value is called 'tot' (e.g. ngoro_tot). 
# It's impossible to get the same dataset as the one from 2021 because we planted the plants and only came back when it was time to collect at the end of the season, thus capturing both survival through the season and germination. 
# to get the total in the "tot" columns, I wrote a formula in excel, written below
# total = if((t0+t2=0),0,if(t0=0,t2,if(t2=0,t0, if(t0+t2=1,1,(t0-1+t2)))))
# in this expression t0 is the germ value (e.g. ngoro_germ) and t2 is the plants value (e.g. ngoro_plants). 
# I can run the analysis with germ, plants, or tot. I'm choosing to do the analysis on tot, but we can revisit this choice if we feel there's a better way to comparably (or not) analyze the data between 2021 and 2023.
